# üéµ Music App

This is a fullstack music application built for practicing modern web development.  
It is developed using **Next.js**, **Material UI**, **React**, and **Redux Toolkit**, with backend functionality handled via **Next.js API routes**.
Files are stored in the **Cloudinary** cloud storage.

The app allows you to play tracks, control playback (play/pause), adjust volume, and serves as a foundation for a more complete music service, including server-side track management and API integration.
